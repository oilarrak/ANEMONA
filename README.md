# ANEMONA
Tools to estimate (bio)chemical reaction kinetic parameters. 

The compressed files include:

ANEMONA_ENG&ESP_v2018.xlsx (Excel file for estimation of enzymatic kinetic parameters),
ANEMONA_ENG&ESP_v2018 (DR).xlsx (Excel file for estimation of Dry Reforming reaction kinetic parameters),
Hernandez_&_Ruiz(1998)Bioinformatics_14;227.pdf (the article describing the template development),
Pino_Recupero_&_Hernandez(2018)ChemEngineering 2, 57 (The article describing its use in DR reaction kinetics),
ANEMONA GPL Licence.txt (Adhesion to GPL Licence for ANEMONA files),
This text file.

Please note that, although I love to maintain it, circumstances make it almost impossible for me to do it as thouroughly as I should like and errors may be found. Nevertheless, I will be happy to provide any help I can if contacted at:

agustin.hernandez@ufscar.br (alternative mail, but much less often checked: oilarrak@yahoo.es).
Previous e-mail addresses ending in @usp.br and @cica.es are no longer in use

For chemistry issues (Dry Reforming reaction-related) you may find useful to contact: lidia.pino@itae.cnr.it
