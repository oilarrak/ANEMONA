# ANEMONA
Tools to estimate (bio)chemical reaction kinetic parameters. 

The compressed files include:
ANEMONA_ENG&ESP_v2018.xlsx (Excel file for estimation of enzymatic kinetic parameters),
ANEMONA_ENG&ESP_v2018 (DR).xlsx (Excel file for estimation of Dry Reforming reaction kinetic parameters),
Hernandez_&_Ruiz(1998)Bioinformatics_14;227.pdf (the article describing the template development),
Pino,_Recupero_&_Hernandez(2018)In press (The article describing is use in DR reaction kinetics. Coming soon!)
ANEMONA GPL Licence.txt (Adhesion to GPL Licence for ANEMONA files)

Please note that, although I love to maintain it, circumstances make it almost impossible for me to do it as thouroughly as I should like and errors may be found. Nevertheless, I will be happy to provide any help I can if contacted at:

agustin.hernandez@usp.br (alternative mail, but much less often checked: ahernan@cica.es)
For chemistry issues (Dry Reforming reaction-related) you may find useful to contact: lidia.pino@itae.cnr.it
Please cite the above papers when publishing your results
